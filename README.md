TargetContract is a contract where you can deposit and withdraw ETH.
This contract is vulnerable to re-entrancy attack.

Steps 
1. Deploy TargetContract
2. Deposit 1 Ether each from Account 1 (Alice) and Account 2 (Bob) into TargetContract
3. Deploy Attack with address of TargetContract
4. Call Attack.attack sending 1 ether (using Account 3 (Eve)).
   You will get 3 Ethers back (2 Ether stolen from Alice and Bob,
   plus 1 Ether sent from this contract).

What happened?
Attack was able to call TargetContract.withdraw multiple times before
TargetContract.withdraw finished executing.

Here is how the functions were called
- Attack.attack
- TargetContract.deposit
- TargetContract.withdraw
- Attack fallback (receives 1 Ether)
- TargetContract.withdraw
- Attack.fallback (receives 1 Ether)
- TargetContract.withdraw
- Attack fallback (receives 1 Ether)


# Preventative Techniques
Ensure all state changes happen before calling external contracts
Use function modifiers that prevent re-entrancy
Here is a example of a re-entracy guard


```bash
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.8;

contract ReEntrancyGuard {
    bool internal locked;

    modifier noReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "No re-entrancy");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
}
```
